      <p>The size of the circle represents the lifespan of the artist.</p>
      <p>In the dataset, there were lifespans of 0. There was also a lifespan of 1,947 years! The right thing to do is to clean the data. However, the tutorial did not state to clean the data. It asked us to <em>"Make a design decision to handle the 0 values."</em> What I did was create a copy of the dataset that only had reasonable ages - greater than 0 and less than 200 (okay, 200 may be a little unreasonable, but I wanted to ensure to capture anyone over 100 in the hypothetical case that additional data is added to this dataset). Then, I created an array of those reasonable ages. When styling the circles, if the age was not in the array of reasonable ages, I assigned them a fill of gray, gave it a lighter opacity, and also assigned it a radius of 1.5. Additionally, those circles do not have tooltips. So, they are still a part of the visualization, but aren't as noticeable. I made design decisions that ensured they weren't going to capture the attention of the viewer.</p>
