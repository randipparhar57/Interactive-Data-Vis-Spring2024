      <p>For this tutorial, I cleaned the dataset. For example, there was Italian and Italy. So, I changed Italian to Italy. Another example is that in the csv, it had "The Neatherlands." But the geojson file had "Neatherlands." So, in the csv I changed "The Neatherlands" to "Neatherlands." Tanzania was in the csv file but not in the geojson. So, I added the geojson data for Tanzania so it would display on the map. Stuff like that.</p>
      <p>Then, I had to address the fact that Italian was showing twice in the data set (56, 3, with a total of 59). Same thing with the USA (5181, 10, with a total of 5191). However, the map was displaying data of a total of 5181 artworks from the USA, not 5191. And 56 for Italy, not 59. I used chatGPT to figure out how to resolve that because I was too lazy to do more manual cleaning.</p>
      <p>I'm sure there is more I could have cleaned up. Missing geojson for countries that are in the csv. Names in the csv that don't match how they are entered in the geojson.</p>
